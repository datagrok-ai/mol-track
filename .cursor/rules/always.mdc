# Always

## Database Conventions
- Never make changes to schema.sql, unless explicitly asked
- Use `snake_case` for all database identifiers (table names, column names)
- All tables must have a primary key named `id`
- Include `created_at` timestamp in all tables
- Foreign keys should be named `{referenced_table_singular}_id`
- Schema-qualify all table references (e.g., `moltrack.compounds`)

## Property System
- Properties must have a value_type from: 'int', 'double', 'bool', 'datetime', 'string'
- Property classes must be one of: 'CALCULATED', 'MEASURED', 'PREDICTED'
- Always include appropriate units for numerical properties
- Document the purpose of each property

## Chemical Structure Handling
- Store canonical SMILES strings for all chemical structures
- Include both InChI and InChIKey for compound identification
- Use RDKit for all molecular operations
- Validate chemical structure input before storage

## Assay Data
- Link all assay results to valid batches and properties
- Include proper validation for measurement values
- Document assay conditions and protocols

## Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces) in SQL
- Add comments for complex queries or triggers
- Follow PostgreSQL best practices for performance

## Unit tests
- run unit tests like that:
  `uv run pytest tests/test_batches.py`

- Document all schema changes in version control
